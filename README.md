## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

There are a couple of things I learnt while building this project;

- How to build a simple project as quick as possible by setting a short time for its completion and prioritizing the elements and properties that are necessary to complete the project


### Continued development

- Widths and max-widths were properties used and proved to be useful, I have seen them used before to make web content scalable, so therefore in future projects, I intend to implement them for responsivity
